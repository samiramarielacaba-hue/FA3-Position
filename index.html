        <h3>Paths</h3>
        <h5>by Niki Zefanya</h5>
    </div>

    <main>
        <p>If God really listens<br>
        Like your mom says He does<br>
        Then He better be saving you<br>
        For our future kids and dogs</p>

        <p>I thought we'd be married<br>
        Two pillars firm and proud<br>
        But real love is a verb<br>
        I get it now</p>

        <p>My youth is in your past<br>
        You'll always have that<br>
        And though it didn't last<br>
        I hope our paths cross again</p>

        <p>If time heals all<br>
        It's a lousy doctor<br>
        Or a half-baked thought<br>
        'Cause I still can't block you</p>

        <p>I came upon family<br>
        And thought I was stifled<br>
        Thought my freedom endangered<br>
        I was just young and entitled</p>

        <p>And you taught me a lot<br>
        Stretched and wrung and tossed<br>
        I'm sorry we got lost<br>
        I hope our paths cross again</p>

        <p>We'll love others<br>
        We'll drift apart<br>
        But every time I sing a song<br>
        You won't feel very far</p>

        <p>The future's ours to write<br>
        The songs, the scars, the life<br>
        I'll catch up with you some other time<br>
        When our paths cross again</p>

        <p>Cross again</p>
